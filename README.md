## Project Overview

### Objective:
To create a web application that connects customers needing transportation services with vehicle owners offering their trucks, lorries, and pickups. The application will facilitate the booking, tracking, and payment of transportation services, providing a seamless experience for both customers and vehicle owners.

### Key Features:
1. **User Registration and Profiles**:
   - **Customer Registration**: Basic user registration using email and password.
   - **Vehicle Owner Registration**: Simple vehicle registration with necessary details like vehicle type, capacity, and registration number.

2. **Booking System**:
   - **Vehicle Search**: Customers can search for available vehicles based on their requirements and proximity.
   - **Booking Request**: Customers can book a vehicle by specifying pick-up and drop-off locations, date, and time.

3. **GPS Integration and Real-Time Tracking**:
   - **Map Integration**: Display available vehicles on a map and allow customers to select the nearest one.
   - **Real-Time Tracking**: Basic tracking of the vehicle's location.

4. **Payment System**:
   - **Fare Calculation**: Simple fare calculation based on distance.
   - **Payment Gateway Integration**: Integration with a single payment gateway (e.g., Stripe) for processing payments.

5. **Ratings and Reviews**:
   - **Feedback System**: Customers can rate and review the service.

6. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - **User Management**: Basic management of customer and vehicle owner accounts.

### Technical Components:
1. **Frontend**:
   - **Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
   - **Frameworks**: Basic setup without extensive frameworks; use vanilla JavaScript or a minimal library like jQuery.
   - **Map Integration**: Google Maps API for displaying vehicles and tracking.

2. **Backend**:
   - **Languages**: Node.js (JavaScript) or Python (Flask).
   - **Frameworks**:
     - **Node.js**: Express.js for building the backend server.
     - **Python**: Flask for a minimal and straightforward backend.
   - **Database**: SQLite for a simple, file-based database solution.

3. **Additional Components**:
   - **Authentication**: Basic session-based authentication using cookies.
   - **Hosting and Deployment**: Heroku for easy deployment.
   - **Security**: HTTPS for secure communication.

### Development Phases:
1. **Planning and Requirements Gathering**: Define basic user stories and use cases.
2. **Design**: Create simple wireframes and database schema design.
3. **Development**:
   - **Frontend Development**: Build a simple user interface with forms and maps.
   - **Backend Development**: Develop basic APIs, implement business logic, and connect to the database.
4. **Testing**: Perform basic unit testing and user acceptance testing.
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the application to Heroku.
6. **Maintenance and Updates**: Regularly update the application with minor improvements and bug fixes.

### Sample Implementation Plan:
1. **Frontend**:
   - Create HTML templates for user registration, vehicle search, booking, and tracking.
   - Use CSS for styling and basic JavaScript or jQuery for interactivity.
   - Integrate Google Maps API for vehicle display and tracking.

2. **Backend**:
   - Set up an Express.js or Flask server.
   - Create endpoints for user registration, vehicle registration, booking, and tracking.
   - Implement simple session-based authentication.
   - Use SQLite for storing user and booking data.

3. **Payment Integration**:
   - Integrate Stripe for processing payments.
   - Implement fare calculation logic on the backend.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the frontend and backend to Heroku.
   - Configure environment variables and database connections.
